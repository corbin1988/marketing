# Marketing For Developers

# Introduction

In the past decade, we've witnessed an incredible surge in internet companies and startups. Alongside this growth, a prevailing mindset of 'move fast, break things, gain traction (users), secure venture capital funding' emerged as the norm for starting new ventures. While this approach thrived in an era of low interest rates and abundant VC investments, times are changing, and we're now facing a new landscape. In this README, we are returning to the core principles of business by how to create a simple marketing plan and conduct basic market research, two essential steps for creating a business plan. 

Typically, when building a business plan, you start by conducting market research and then constructing a marketing plan based on that research. In this README, we'll be taking a different approach. We'll begin by explaining what a marketing plan is and what it contains to provide you with guidance and structure for conducting what you need during market research. After covering the essentials of a marketing plan, we will proceed to discuss how to conduct basic market research.

# Marketing Plan

**What is a marketing plan?**

A marketing plan is a detailed, strategic document that serves as a guide, outlining who your customers are, what products or services you'll offer them, where to find them, why they should choose you, when to reach out, and how to do it effectively. This plan provides a roadmap for achieving specific business goals by detailing target audiences, marketing strategies, tactics, budgets, and timelines.

**Do you need to write a marketing plan to start a business?**

Absolutely not. However, it’s my personal opinion that every aspiring entrepreneur should do this once as an exercise. A marketing plan can be an extremely comprehensive document to make, and often despite one’s best efforts they can be wrong. From my knowledge, pitch decks are usually the way to go if seeking funding. So why make this once? The power of a marketing plan is structuring, evaluating, and validating your own ideas so you can take a calculated risk. Doing this at least once in your life will give you a framework to quickly make these evaluations in the future. 

## Marketing Plan Structure

## Mission

The mission part of a marketing plan starts with the general statement (mission statement) that states the overall goal you hope to accomplish with your marketing plan and subsequent objectives that meet that goal. A basic understanding on how to structure your goal, objectives, and tasks(not a part of section but relevant) would be:

1. **Goal:** A goal is a specific thing you want to accomplish in a given time frame. For this example our goal will be to build a chair.
2. **Objectives:** Objectives are the broken down pieces that meet the goal. Going back to our chair example. Each piece of the chair (The back rest, the seat, the legs) could be an objective that meets the general goal.
3. **Tasks:** Tasks can be thought of as a break down of objectives. Using our chair example: Each leg would need to be cut, the seat and backrest sanded in order to not give the user splinters, and some varnish to protect the wood of the chair. 

### Mission Statement

A marketing plan mission statement is a concise and clear statement that defines the fundamental purpose and values of a company or brand. It serves as a guiding principle for the organization's marketing efforts, helping to align everyone involved with a common vision and purpose. For example here's Nintendo's mission statement:

>At Nintendo, we are dedicated to creating unique and innovative entertainment experiences that delight and surprise players around the world. We aim to bring smiles to people's faces through our products, fostering fun, creativity, and the joy of play.


### Objectives

While a mission statement provides a broad sense of the company's mission and values, specific objectives are typically detailed under the mission statement. These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)  to provide a clear roadmap for the marketing team and ensure alignment with the overall business goals and mission.

## Marketing Strategy

In this section, you take the things you've learned from your market research and use them to define your target audience, set measurable goals that align with your findings, and develop a budget for those goals.

### Define Your Target Audience

This is where you compile all of your market research to define:

(Note: there will be more specifics about this in the market research section)

- **Who** your competitors and target market (customers) are.
- **Where** you will reach your target market.
- **How** you will reach that target market.

### Set measurable goals

Once you understand how you want to reach your target market you will begin to define measurable goals for your advertising efforts. For example, let's say your target audiance uses Facebook a good goal could be: Purchase [x] amount of Facebook ads, specific to [y] demographic, in [z] region, over [period of time].

### Develop a budget

After you have specific goals you give the amount of money you want to spend on each goal. 

## The Marketing Mix and the Four Ps

The marketing mix, commonly known as the 'Four Ps,' serves as a framework for businesses to create and execute successful marketing strategies. These Four Ps constitute the controllable elements that allow a company to shape customer purchasing decisions and attain its marketing objectives. They guide how you communicate the value of your product to customers, emphasizing the importance of positioning your product and highlighting its competitive advantages. It's crucial to establish clarity regarding your marketing focus—is it centered on convenience or quality? Additionally, understanding your target audience, those most likely to purchase your product or service, is essential.

### Four Ps of the Marketing Mix

- **Product:** This refers to the tangible or intangible goods or services that a company offers to meet the needs and wants of its target market. Companies must consider factors like product features, design, quality, branding, and packaging when designing their products.

- **Price:** Price represents the amount of money customers are willing to pay for a product or service. Pricing strategies can include setting prices lower than competitors (penetration pricing), matching competitors' prices (competitive pricing), or pricing products higher to emphasize quality or exclusivity (premium pricing). Pricing decisions also involve considerations like discounts, promotions, and pricing models.

- **Place (Distribution):** Place refers to the channels and methods a company uses to make its products or services available to customers. This includes decisions about distribution channels (e.g., online sales, physical stores, wholesalers, retailers), logistics, inventory management, and ensuring products are accessible to the target market.

- **Promotion:** Promotion encompasses all the activities a company uses to communicate with its target audience and persuade them to purchase its products or services. This includes advertising, public relations, sales promotions, social media marketing, content marketing, and other forms of communication. The goal is to create awareness, generate interest, and ultimately drive sales.

### How To Create Your Own Marketing Mix

As always your decsions from your Four Ps should come from market research. Here's a nice chart I found to fill out the Four Ps of your product/service:
