# Marketing For Developers

# Introduction

In the past decade, we've witnessed an incredible surge in internet companies and startups. Alongside this growth, a prevailing mindset of 'move fast, break things, gain traction (users), secure venture capital funding' emerged as the norm for starting new ventures. While this approach thrived in an era of low interest rates and abundant VC investments, times are changing, and we're now facing a new landscape. In this README, we are returning to the core principles of business by how to create a simple marketing plan and conduct basic market research, two essential steps for creating a business plan. 

Typically, when building a business plan, you start by conducting market research and then constructing a marketing plan based on that research. In this README, we'll be taking a different approach. We'll begin by explaining what a marketing plan is and what it contains to provide you with guidance and structure for conducting what you need during market research. After covering the essentials of a marketing plan, we will proceed to discuss how to conduct basic market research.

# Marketing Plan

What is a marketing plan?

A marketing plan is like a detailed roadmap that answers the essential questions of who, what, where, why, when, and how for your business's marketing efforts.

Do you need to write a marketing plan to start a business?

Absolutely not. However, it’s my personal opinion that every aspiring entrepreneur should do this once as an exercise. A marketing plan can be an extremely comprehensive document to make, and often despite one’s best efforts they can be wrong. From my knowledge, pitch decks are usually the way to go if seeking funding. So why make this once? The power of a marketing plan is structuring, evaluating, and validating your own ideas so you can take a calculated risk. Doing this at least once in your life will give you a framework to quickly make these evaluations in the future. 

## Marketing Plan Structure

## Mission

The mission part of a marketing plan starts with the general goal you hope to accomplish. A basic understanding on how to structure your goal, objectives, and tasks(not a part of section but relevant) would be:

1. **Goal:** A goal is a specific thing you want to accomplish in a given time frame. For this example our goal will be to build a chair.
2. **Objectives:** Objectives are the broken down pieces that meet the goal. Going back to our chair example. Each piece of the chair (The back rest, the seat, the legs) could be an objective that meets the general goal.
3. **Tasks:** Tasks can be thought of as a break down of objectives. Using our chair example: Each leg would need to be cut, the seat and backrest sanded in order to not give the user splinters, and some varnish to protect the wood of the chair. 

A marketing plan mission statement is a concise and clear statement that defines the fundamental purpose and objectives of a marketing plan. It serves as a guiding principle for the marketing efforts outlined in the plan, helping to align everyone involved with a common vision and purpose. For example here's Nintendo's mission statement:

>At Nintendo, we are dedicated to creating unique and innovative entertainment experiences that delight and surprise players around the world. We aim to bring smiles to people's faces through our products, fostering fun, creativity, and the joy of play.
